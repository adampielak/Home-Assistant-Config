# Alexa (& Sonos) Door/Window Announce : AppDaemon (HASS) :chicken:

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Default-orange.svg)](https://github.com/custom-components/hacs)

Alexa announces your doors/windows opening and closing. Comes in handy specially for garage doors or side/main exits for homes and shops where you need to stay informed of any changes. Trust me, it's a secured feeling to know the status of your garage, main/side exits. 

Ever since we've set this up in our home, we don't think we can do without it now. Your home suddenly gets a voice, something like Jarvis ... Awesome!
